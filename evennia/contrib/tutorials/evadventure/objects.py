"""
All items in the game inherit from a base object. The properties (what you can do
with an object, such as wear, wield, eat, drink, kill etc) are all controlled by
Tags.

Every object has one of a few `obj_type`-category tags:
- weapon
- armor
- shield
- helmet
- consumable  (potions, torches etc)
- magic (runestones, magic items)
- quest (quest-items)
- treasure  (valuable to sell)

It's possible for an item to have more than one tag, such as a golden helmet (helmet+treasure) or
rune sword (weapon+quest).
